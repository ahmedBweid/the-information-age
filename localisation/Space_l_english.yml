space.1.t:0 "[USA.GetName] starts the InSight Program"
 space.1.d:0 "\n\nToday, the president of the United States [USA.GetLeader] announced the start of the InSight Program by NASA. The Programs aims to land a second rover on Mars to measure its seismic activities and its internal heat flow. The project had already been delayed in 2016 but will now be completed.\nIt is scheduled to launch at the end of 2018."
 space.1.a:0 "To Mars! For the second time!"
 space.1.b:0 "Looking forward to the images."
space.2.t:0 "Gouvernment funding for InSight launched!"
 space.2.d:0 "We are now collecting money from weekly activities for the next 3 months. It should be enough time to collect the 650.000.000$ we need.\n\n§RPS: You need to access the NASA research window through the politics window to start working on the project.§!"
 space.2.a:0 "Nice!"

 initiate_insight_programm:0 "Officially restart the Insight Program"
 initiate_insight_programm_desc:0 "A lof of time has passed since 2010 and since the approval of the GEMS in 2011. NASA changed the name in 2012 and sceduled it for launch in March 2016. But we had problems with a vacuum leak in the CNES-supplied seismometer. NASA asked us the restart the program now."
