 INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "With the threat of the Islamic State almost gone, the war in Ukraine still happening, and North Korea rearming quickly, the world fears another great war. Economic sanctions will not stop the dictatorship, Russia and China have protected Kim Jong-un and they have challenged the Americans. Will our world collapse into war again?"
 ENG_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a sovereign country lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland. The United Kingdom includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom that shares a land border with a sovereign state‍—‌the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the United Kingdom is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world."
 FRA_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "The French Republic is a country whose territory consists of metropolitan France in Western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The metropolitan area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. It is bordered by Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast, Switzerland and Italy to the east, and Andorra and Spain to the south. The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans."
 GER_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "Germany is hit by the refugee crisis and the immigrant crisis. Merkel is only one of the last standing non-far-right politicians that are keeping Germany and the European Union united. Their technological and industrial economy is still working, but the politics are their main problem to face now. Perhaps it's time to abandon the disappointment from the two world wars and enforce some border control? Or will the Germans continue with their open border policies?"
 JAP_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "Japan is faced with the possibility of war each passing day, as Chinese naval vessels aggressively close into the Senkaku Islands and recently a North Korean missile was launched into the stratosphere that almost hit the island. Article 9 of the Japanese constitution has been amended to allow for a more active Japanese military abroad. This militaristic stance is unpopular with the people, but perhaps necessary to maintain the national security."
 ITA_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "Italy has been in an economic collapse since 2008. They have tried to invest and recover, but with organized crime and other corruption scandals it was almost impossible. The refugee crisis in Europe was a last spark in the powder keg of the italian politics, Many terrorists have been killing italians and disrespecting the european culture, the far-right rises now in coalitions and the rise of fascism or populism seems to be an unstoppable event more than a future possibility. Will Fascism or Monarchism be brought back?"
 PRC_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "China is decaying in geopolitics. They protect the North Koreans and have alliances with Russia, but Kim Jong Un has been causing problems that could spark a nuclear war and many embargos were not enough. But abandoning the North Koreans is not a good choice either, having American-influenced South Korea on their borders is a nightmare. The future is unsure for the Chinese. Their booming economy which once was the fastest growing is having trouble competing with India and a major change for democracy or a return to Marxism may happen."
 RAJ_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "India's economy is rapidly growing, and so is its population. Still not greatly in the international spotlight, the Tiger is well-fed and growling. India is on the hunt, and its prey ever-so unsuspecting."
 SPR_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "Like other Southern European countries, Spain has fallen into economic crisis in 2008, requiring economic stimuli from Northern European economies. Podemos and Ciudadanos have brought a new populism and new uncertainty to the old political system, while Catalonian independence movements are more threatening to Spanish unity than ever.\n\nEconomic Recovery will be a long and rocky path - will Spain stay with Europe and stick to the agreements that prevent immediate disaster - or is the future of Spain a different one from the future of Northern Europe?"
 SOV_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "Russia is in an economic crisis since the federation was the target of sanctions from the EU. The Crimean War was costly but mostly worth it. Now they have a good grasp on Ukraine and on Crimea. China is now a great economic partner, and maybe with their help, they can recover. The North Korean problem still threatens the stability of the greater United Russia that Putin proposes, as if Kim Jong Un falls, they will have another American-influenced country within their borders, but now on the east. Will Russia rise greater and united? Will communism rise again? Or will liberalism change the mind of the Russian population?"
 USA_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "The United States of America is the superpower of the world, who claims to be the beacon of freedom and democracy. With the new President elected, he will have not only to deal with the problems of North Korea and China but with his liberal opposition. Will Trump truly make America Great Again or will his government end in a failure for the american people? This is a fate you shall decide."
 PRK_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or North Korea for short, is a rapidly growing nuclear power and is threatening the stability of the World, having China as an ally to the North, and to the South the Republic of Korea, they stand strong agaisnt the imperialists of the west."
 KOR_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "The Republic of Korea, colloquially known as 'South Korea', is a regional power in East Asia, hosting the world's 11th largest economy, just above Russia and just below Canada. South Korea is known for its innovation in technology, booming export-oriented economy, strong educational system, and active military forces. Due to the continued threats of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), the Republic of Korea has been forced to maintain a strong military force, while balancing the needs of its people and the economy."
 SWE_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "If the United States is the greatest military power in the world, Sweden is definetely the greatest diplomatic power in the world. The Swedish passport allows you to visit 174 different countries without a visa. Sweden is a member of the European Union and has not fought a war since 1814. With no outside conflict, Sweden is divided because of the refugee crisis between Social-democrats and Libertarians. Some might say that euroscepticists will gain popularity."
 OTHER_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "Crimea, the Islamic State, North Korean nuclear weapons. With conflict ever growing, the minor nations of the world need to find a way to either preserve peace or to destroy their enemies as quickly as possible."
